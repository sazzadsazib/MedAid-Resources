Many people, however, have no symptoms. The inflammation is caused by the hepatitis B virus, one of the three most common hepatitis viruses (the others are hepatitis A and C). The disease spreads through blood, vaginal fluid, semen, and other body fluids of an infected person. The virus can be passed by sharing drug needles, having sex with an infected person, and sharing personal items such as toothbrushes or razors. A mother can pass the disease to her child at birth. Most people who get the hepatitis B virus fight it off in six months with rest and close monitoring by a doctor. Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B, a more serious form of the disease. Treatment with antiviral medication helps prevent liver damage in people with chronic hepatitis B. The hepatitis B vaccine offers lifelong immunity against this infection.','Nearly 40,000 people in the U.S. get hepatitis B every year.','Anti-nausea medications and other treatments help relieve symptoms in people with acute hepatitis B. Your doctor may suggest avoiding certain medications that are toxic to the liver while you are recovering.

For reasons doctors don\'t understand, the body begins to attack healthy tissue. There are several types. The most common is systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE-- it\'s often simply called lupus. It may affect the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, and other organs. It\'s more common in women, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans. Other types of lupus -- such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus -- only affect the skin. Occasionally, medications can trigger temporary lupus. Good treatment is crucial. Keep in mind that more common and much less serious conditions can cause many of the same symptoms.','Lupus is relatively uncommon. Doctors diagnose about 2 to 8 people out of every 100,000 in the U.S. with systemic lupus erythematosus each year.','Treatments for lupus include: \n\nNSAIDs for swelling and pain \nCorticosteroid creams and oral medications \nAntimalarial drugs \nMedications to suppress the immune system \nPlasmapheresis where the liquid in the blood, or plasma, is separated from the cells and replaced with a substitute.\nTreatments for related problems or organ damage','Your doctor will ask questions and examine you. You may need blood and urine tests, X-rays, biopsies, and other tests.'),(8,'Mumps','Fever,Swelling,Joint aches,Decreased appetite,Enlarged or swollen glands,Fatigue','Mumps is a contagious viral disease that causes painful swelling of the glands that produce saliva. The virus also causes headaches, face pain, fever, muscle aches, and sore throat. Sometimes, mumps can cause swelling and pain of the testicles in adolescent and adult men. While more common in children, anyone who has not been vaccinated or who has not had mumps before can get the disease. Treatment includes pain relievers, ice packs to relieve swelling, and rest. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin, which is associated with a rare but serious illness called Reyes syndrome. Because the disease can spread quickly, the CDC recommends that anyone with mumps be isolated for 5 days after swelling begins. Most people recover fully from the mumps and are immune from it for the rest of their lives. Because of routine vaccination, mumps now rarely occurs in the U.S.','Because of the mumps vaccine, the illness has become rare in the U.S., affecting only a few hundred people a year.

It usually infects the lungs, but it can also affect other areas such as the spine, brain, kidneys, and intestines. TB spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, which releases droplets into the air that other people can breathe in. If not treated, the disease can be serious and even fatal. TB causes a bad cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, fever, chills, and fatigue. Some people are infected with TB bacteria but don\'t have any symptoms and are not contagious. However, the disease can become active later and make them sick. People with a weak immune system, such as from HIV, are at higher risk for TB infection. Living in unsanitary conditions, abusing alcohol or drugs, and working with people who have TB also increases the risk. Taking several medications over a period of months will cure most cases of TB unless it\'s caused by a drug resistant version of the bacterium. Not taking medication correctly increases the risk of developing treatment-resistant TB.','About 11,500 people in the U.S. get TB every year.','TB treatment may include: \n\nMedication taken for 9 months to kill TB bacteria and prevent the active disease in people with latent TB. \nSeveral medications taken from 6 months to a year to kill TB bacteria in people with active TB and prevent the disease from spreading.','Smoking, having a weak immune system'),(11,'Acute Sinusitis','Headache, Pain or discomfort,Swelling, Bad breath,Cough,Decreased smell','Acute sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses caused by infection lasting less than 4 weeks. Sinusitis often develops when swelling, inflammation, and mucus from a cold block nasal passages. This makes it easier for bacteria to grow. Organisms can produce gas, and when your sinuses are not draining, pressure can quickly build and cause the infection to spread. Viruses are the most common cause of acute sinusitis, but bacteria, fungi, and allergies may also cause it. Sinus pain and tenderness are common, but severe pain may indicate an abscess or other complication.','About 12% of people will develop sinusitis in a given year.','Treatments for acute sinusitis may include: \n\nFlushing nasal passages with warm salt water (Neti pot) or saline nasal spray\nWarm packs \nAntibiotics for bacterial infections \nCortisone and other nasal sprays for inflammation and allergy control \nSinus drainage procedures \nOral antihistamines and/or decongestants','Allergies, air pollution, wood stoves, smoking, upper respiratory infections, immune deficiencies, nasal polyps, snorting drugs up the nose.'),(12,'Migraine Headache','Headache,Nausea or vomiting,Numbness or tingling,Sensitive to light,Sensitive to noise,Flickering lights in vision','Migraines are a common type of headache that can cause severe pain. They can last for a few hours or a few days and may cause throbbing, sensitivity to sound or light, nausea, or vomiting. Migraines are caused by abnormal brain activity that is triggered by certain foods, stress, or other factors. Some people have an aura before a migraine, which can have symptoms that include temporary vision loss, seeing stars or flashes, or a tingling in an arm or leg. There is no cure for migraines, but medications can help reduce pain or stop migraines from occurring.','About 1 in 10 people have migraine headaches.','Some migraines can be treated at home with over-the-counter pain relievers. \n\nSevere migraines are usually treated with prescription medicines called triptans, anti-nausea medicine, or sedatives.

Fever, general aches and pains, headache, weakness, and lack of appetite are common symptoms. Until typhoid fever is treated, it is highly contagious. You can get it from contaminated food or water or close contact with someone who has it. It occurs most often in developing countries with poor sanitation. It is rare in the U.S. Most cases are due to international travel. Untreated, typhoid fever can be fatal. Antibiotics clear it up, but a small number of people become carriers and need further treatment. A vaccine can also help prevent typhoid fever.','There are about 400 cases of typhoid fever in the U.S. each year.','Treatment\nTreatment of typhoid fever may include: \n\nAntibiotics \nFluids to prevent dehydration from diarrhea or fever \nCorticosteroids in severe cases, to treat symptoms such as seizures or shock \nEmergency surgery for perforated intestine \nGallbladder surgery if antibiotics aren\'t effective in eliminating the bacteria in carriers','Intestinal bleeding or perforation'),(14,'Brain Tumor','Headache,Loss of balance,Memory problems,Nausea or vomiting,Slurred speech,Change in vision','Primary brain tumors start in the brain.

There are many different types of seizures, depending on which part and how much of the brain is affected. Epilepsy that causes partial seizures begins in one local area of the brain. Partial seizures are divided into simple and complex partial seizures. During simple partial seizures, people remain fully conscious and able to respond to external stimuli. During complex partial seizures, people lose consciousness briefly. Most people with epilepsy are able to control their symptoms with the use of anti-seizure medications. Surgery can sometimes be performed to remove the damaged brain cells that cause seizures.','An estimated 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. Most adult-onset epilepsies are partial epilepsies.','If your seizures are caused by an underlying condition, your doctor will recommend treatments based on the medical problem that is causing them. For epilepsy not linked to other conditions, many anti-seizure drugs are available. These can prevent and stop seizures. Medications often need to be adjusted, especially when you first begin taking them. If medications don\'t control seizures, your doctor may talk to you about surgery to remove the abnormal cells in the brain that are causing seizures. Another option is vagus nerve stimulation, which delivers short bursts of electrical energy into the brain via a large nerve in the neck. In some cases, seizures may also be controlled by following a diet very high in fats and low in carbohydrates, called a ketogenic diet.','Drinking alcohol, smoking, not getting enough sleep, stress'),(21,'Diabetes, type 2','Blurred vision,Dizziness,Double vision (without one eye covered),Fatigue,Frequent urination,Headache,Weight gain','Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not make enough insulin or does not use it as it should.

But often people don\'t know how much caffeine they\'ve consumed, because the drug is not only in coffee but in tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, and some medications.','It\'s estimated that millions of people in the U.S. consume too much caffeine each day.','Treatment for caffeine overuse involves gradually cutting back, then using caffeine in moderation or avoiding caffeine altogether.','Certain medications, excess alcohol, smoking, drug use, poor diet'),(60,'Encephalitis','Confusion,Fever,Headache,Nausea or vomiting,Stiff neck,Personality changes','Encephalitis is swelling and inflammation of the brain from an infection. Viruses, often spread by mosquito and tick bites, usually cause encephalitis. Other less common causes include fungi, parasites, bacteria, and autoimmune disorders. A brain infection causes sleepiness, fever, headaches, neck pain and stiffness, nausea, fatigue, confusion, sensitivity to light, seizures, loss of consciousness, and coma. Encephalitis can be life threatening, so it\'s important to get immediate medical help. Treatment may include medication and hospitalization.','About 1 in 200,000 people in the U.S. gets encephalitis each year.','Treatment for encephalitis may include: \n\n    Hospitalization and IV fluids \n    Anticonvulsants \n    Antiviral medications \n    Antibiotics for encephalitis caused by bacteria \n    Sedatives','Waiting to get medical treatment'),(61,'Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)','Anxiety,Confusion,Fatigue,Fainting,Nausea or vomiting,Numbness or tingling','Low blood sugar happens when blood sugar, or glucose, levels in the blood drop too low. It causes shakiness, anxiety, clammy skin, irritability, headache, rapid heartbeat, and hunger. People with diabetes often get low blood sugar, which can be caused by diabetes medications, not eating enough, or exercising. Low blood sugar can be life-threatening for people with diabetes and cause seizures, coma, and even death. Certain medical conditions including cancer, medications, tumors, excess alcohol use, and hereditary conditions can cause low blood sugar in people who don\'t have diabetes. Some people have a condition called reactive hypoglycemia, which causes low blood sugar within four hours after eating. Treatment for low blood sugar depends on what\'s causing it. People with diabetes can prevent low blood sugar by checking their blood sugar levels regularly and keeping levels in a normal range. Treating underlying medical conditions can treat low blood sugar. Eating small meals every three hours can help manage reactive hypoglycemia.','Millions of people have occasional or mild low blood sugar, but people with diabetes who take insulin and other blood sugar-lowering medications are most susceptible to significant low blood sugar.','Treatment for low blood sugar includes: \n\n    Taking a small amount of carbohydrates \n    Adjusting medications \n    Making changes to your diet \n    Treating any underlying medical conditions','Taking too much insulin or diabetes medication, poor diet, not eating regular meals, over-exercising without adjusting insulin dose or diet'),(62,'Dementia in Head Injury','Agitation,Confusion,Difficulty sleeping,Fatigue,Headache,Memory problems','People who have a serious head injury can develop dementia. They may have memory problems, difficulty speaking, and personality changes. Some people with dementia after a head injury get better over months and years. Others don\'t. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of a single head injury that leads to dementia. Repeated blows to the head can cause dementia symptoms that will not emerge until years later. This is called boxer\'s syndrome. Treatment focuses on helping the person adjust and relieving symptoms. Anyone who has just had a potentially serious head injury should go to the emergency room.','About 1.7 million people in the U.S. have a traumatic brain injury each year.','Treatments for dementia after a head injury include:\n\n    Behavior modification and rehabilitation with different therapists\n    Medications to treat symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or insomnia','Not getting treatment, returning to work or physical activity too soon'),(63,'Depression','Anxiety,Difficulty sleeping,Fatigue,Constipation,Decreased appetite,Depressed mood','Depression is a painful sadness or down mood that interferes with daily life. Many people feel down for short periods, but depression lasts a long time and may include anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms. Life events such as the death of a loved one can trigger depression. The illness can run in families, but people with no family history also become depressed. Often, there is no clear cause. Depression is a common but serious illness that usually doesn\'t go away without treatment. Counseling and/or antidepressant medication can treat depression in most people.','16.5% of people in the U.S. will experience depression in their lifetime.','Depression treatment may include: \n\n    Antidepressant medication \n    Counseling \n    Electroconvulsive therapy for severe depression and if antidepressants don\'t work','Psychological stress, drug and alcohol use or abuse, poor diet, lack of exercise, and social isolation'),(64,'Heart rhythm disorder','Dizziness,Fatigue,Fainting,Pain or discomfort,Feeling faint,Irregular heartbeat','','About 2.2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, including 3% to 5% of people over 65.','Treatment for heart rhythm disorders varies depending on the type of disorder you have. Some of these treatments include: \n\n    Medications to stop the arrhythmia \n    A pacemaker or implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD) \n    Cardioversion, a shock to reset your heart \n    Ablation therapy, which destroys tissue to stop the abnormal heartbeat \n    Surgery','Stress, infection, fever, alcohol, caffeine, methamphetamines, cocaine, some medications'),(65,'Lyme Disease','Swelling,Difficulty sleeping,Fatigue,Fever,Headache,Fainting','Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread through tick bites. A tick may feed on a mouse or deer with the bacteria and then bite a person, spreading the disease. Lyme disease may cause a rash and flu-like symptoms. Prompt treatment with antibiotics can prevent complications such as joint and nerve problems. Keep in mind that the majority of tick bites don\'t result in Lyme disease -- or any other disease. Other more common conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of Lyme disease.','In 2009, doctors diagnosed between 30,000 and 40,000 new cases of Lyme disease in the U.S.','Treatments for Lyme disease include: \n\n    Antibiotics \n    NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen, for pain and swelling',NULL),(66,'Aseptic Meningitis','Agitation,Confusion,Fatigue,Fever,Headache,Pain or discomfort','Aseptic meningitis, or viral meningitis, is an inflammation of the lining around the brain and spinal cord. It\'s usually caused by a virus. Less often, fungi, diseases spread by insects, and other conditions trigger it. Aseptic meningitis is usually not as serious as bacterial meningitis, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms include fever, headaches, neck pain and stiffness, nausea, fatigue, confusion, and sensitivity to light. Most often, aseptic meningitis goes away on its own with rest, fluids, and pain relievers. However, any signs of meningitis are always a medical emergency. The symptoms of aseptic meningitis are often the same as those of bacterial meningitis, which is life-threatening without treatment.','About 1 in 9,000 adults and children develop aseptic meningitis each year in the U.S.','Treatment for aseptic meningitis caused by a virus involves getting plenty of rest and taking over-the-counter medication for fever, headache, and muscle aches. Antibiotics won\'t cure viral meningitis. If something other than a virus caused the illness, other treatments may include: \n\n    Treatment for some underlying causes, such as a fungal infection \n    Hospital stay for severe cases','Not seeing a doctor; not resting, not drinking enough fluids'),(67,'Panic Attacks','Anxiety,Dizziness,Pain or discomfort,Giddiness,Irregular heartbeat,Nausea or vomiting','When someone has a panic attack, that person feels a sudden, intense fear that can\'t be controlled. People who have panic attacks often feel like they are having a heart attack, losing control, suffocating, or dying. During the panic attack, the person also may have chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, chills, sweating, dizziness, or a feeling of choking. Doctors don\'t know for certain what causes panic attacks, but it may have to do with genetics or stress.','About 5% of people will have a panic attack at some point in their life.','Treatment for panic attacks may include: \n\n    Antidepressant medications, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor)\n    Mild sedatives, such as alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin)\n    Cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, or other types of therapy','Alcohol, caffeine, illegal drugs'),(68,'Thyroid Storm','Anxiety,Confusion,Difficulty sleeping,Fever,Pain or discomfort,Palpitations (fluttering in chest)','A thyroid storm occurs when the thyroid gland goes into overdrive, producing dangerously high levels of thyroid hormone. It often is associated with Graves\' disease or hyperthyroidism. Symptoms include high fever, racing heartbeat, and excessive sweating. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate emergency care. Emergency room doctors treat thyroid storm by administering electrolytes, intravenous fluids, as well as drugs to block the production of thyroid hormone or control their effect on tissues and organs like the heart (beta blockers).','Thyroid storm is a rare disorder. Approximately 1%-2% of patients with hyperthyroidism experience thyroid storm.','Doctors will give you intravenous fluids, electrolytes, and oxygen if needed to stabilize your condition. They will then try to determine the cause of the thyroid storm. Medications may include drugs to lower fever, reduce inflammation, and block the production of thyroid hormones. Beta blockers are also important.','\nEmergency\n\nIf you have the symptoms of thyroid storm, go to an emergency room or call 911 immediately. This is a life-threatening condition that can be fatal without prompt treatment.'),(69,'Tension Headache','Headache,Pain or discomfort,Stiff neck,Difficulty concentrating','Tension headaches are the most common type of headache, caused by muscle tension in the neck, face, jaw, or shoulders. Many people have occasional tension headaches, which often start in the middle of the day. For others, tension headaches occur every day. Everyday stress, lack of sleep, anxiety, depression, bad posture, hunger, and tiredness can all trigger a tension headache.','Among U.S. adults, 30% to 80% have occasional tension headaches.','Treatment for tension headaches includes: \n\n    Pain relievers \n    Muscle relaxants \n    Medication to help prevent headaches','Stress, poor posture, hunger'),(70,'Atrial Fibrillation','Confusion,Dizziness,Fatigue,Fainting,Pain or discomfort,Feeling faint','Atrial fibrillation is the most common problem with the heart\'s rhythm. It is also the main cause of heart failure and a major risk for stroke. The heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers are called atria. Blood enters these chambers, which then contract to fill the lower chambers, called ventricles. Then the lower chambers contract and pump blood to the rest of the body. With a normal heartbeat, contractions follow in order, and both the upper and lower chambers work at the same pace. With fibrillation, though, the upper chambers beat much faster than the lower ones. So the ventricles don\'t fill completely and the heart has to work harder to get blood to the rest of the body.','A half-million new cases of atrial fibrillation are diagnosed each year in the U.S.','Treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are and whether or not you already have heart disease. \n\n    If there is something causing the fibrillation, the first step is to address it. This could mean making lifestyle changes such as cutting out alcohol or caffeine and eating a heart-healthy diet. It also could mean treating a medical condition such as an overactive thyroid. \n    The doctor may prescribe heart rhythm medications such as calcium channel blockers. \n    You may need to take a blood thinner such as warfarin to reduce your risk of stroke. \n    In some cases, doctors use electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm, a process called cardioversion. \n    Surgery may be an option if other treatments do not work.','Certain medications, hyperthyroidism, too much thyroid, too much caffeine, alcohol, and magnesium deficiency'),(71,'Cryptococcus','Dizziness,Fever,Headache,Pain or discomfort,Blurred vision,Cough','Cryptococcus is a fungus found in soil or bird droppings. When inhaled, it can infect the lungs, causing a disease called cryptococcosis. Most healthy people can fight off the infection; many never even have symptoms. However, cryptococcosis can be dangerous for those with weak immune systems. People with HIV and Hodgkin\'s disease -- and people getting chemotherapy or immunosuppressant drugs-- have a greater risk. In them, cryptococcosis is more likely to spread, causing life-threatening lung infections and meningitis. Prompt treatment with antifungal drugs is crucial.','Cryptococcus neoformans infects about 1 million people in the U.S. each year.','Doctors prescribe antifungal medications to treat cryptococcosis.','Not getting prompt treatment');
